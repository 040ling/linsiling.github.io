I graduated from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) [Microelectronics Science and Engineering](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/) for my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. My research interests include computer vision, diffusion generation, machine learning, and inference acceleration. I am currently working at Honor.

I am lucky to be guided by [Professor Haibao Chen] of the Smart Vision Lab of the [School of Microelectronics Science and Engineering](https://dmne.sjtu.edu.cn/dmne/) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Currently, I am working in the company on research on algorithms related to image and video generation and inference acceleration
